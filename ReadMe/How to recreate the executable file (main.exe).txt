To recreate main.exe from your Python project using PyInstaller, follow these steps:

STEP 1:
In the root directory of the project, activate the virtual environment by using the following bash code: ".\.venv\Scripts\Activate
"
STEP 2:
Clean old builds (optional but recommended) by typing: "Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build, dist, main.spec
"
STEP 3:
Recreate main.exe using PyInstaller with this code: "pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py
"
--onefile: Packages everything into a single .exe.
--noconsole: Prevents the console window from opening (for GUI apps).

STEP 4:
Locate the generated main.exe, it will be created in the dist/ directory. Probably in C:\Users\your_own_username\PycharmProjects\your_apllication's_name\dist\main.exe

STEP 5:
Double-click main.exe to ensure it works.
